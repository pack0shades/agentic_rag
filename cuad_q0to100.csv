                                                   acts, omissions or misrepresentations to the extent that the
                                                    Indemnified Party is deemed a principal of the Indemnifying
                                                 Party.  In addition, 2TheMart shall indemnify i-Escrow against
                                                      any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including

Rank 5: 8.2 TERMINATION FOR BREACH.  In addition to other remedies that
may be available to it, by providing written notice, a party
may immediately terminate this Agreement: (a) if the other party
materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure that
breach within sixty (60) days after receiving written
notice of the breach, or (b) as provided in Sections 2.2  [INITIAL INFORMATION TRANSFER MECHANISM DEVELOPMENT],
2.4  [RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS], or 12.4.
","In the provided context, the relevant section regarding ""Change of Control"" is found in Rank 3, specifically Section 8.3, which states:

""8.3 TERMINATION FOR CHANGE IN COMPANY STRUCTURE. If a majority of the equity securities of either 2TheMart or i-Escrow, Inc. ... are acquired by another company during the term of this Agreement either company may terminate this Agreement, without liability, by giving a thirty (30) days written notice to the other party.""

This indicates that either party has the right to terminate the agreement without liability if a change of control occurs, but they must provide thirty days written notice to the other party.

Key considerations for review by a lawyer include:
- The definition of ""majority of equity securities"" and its implications.
- Clarity on what constitutes a ""change in company structure.""
- The implications of notice requirements and potential liability implications upon termination.
- Understanding any exclusions specified in the section regarding which transfers do not trigger termination rights.

These points should be carefully examined to ensure both parties are aware of their rights and obligations under change of control scenarios.",1

2. **Sublicensing Rights**: ""In addition, 2TheMart may grant sublicenses to companies that 2TheMart has a business relationship with...""

These sections imply that parties can engage third parties (such as a web host), but the actions of these third parties could still constitute a breach of the Agreement, suggesting control over assignments or use of third parties.

2. **Rank 3**: Discusses non-exclusive rights for i-Escrow to use certain content in conjunction with 2TheMart auctions, and it indicates that ownership of the respective content is retained by each party. This suggests that while there is the possibility of shared usage rights, each party maintains ownership over their respective intellectual property.

3. **Content Ownership (Section 6.2)**: This section states that 2TheMart and its suppliers retain all rights to the 2TheMart Content, while i-Escrow and its suppliers retain rights to their own content. This explicitly indicates that there is no joint ownership.

Given that the limitations on liability are specifically excluded in cases of breach of confidentiality, this could imply that liability for such breaches is uncapped.

           and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
                California without giving effect to conflict of laws
           principles.  Both parties submit to personal jurisdiction
            in California and further agree that any cause of action
            arising under this Agreement shall be brought in a court
                                       in Orange County, California.
       12.2 SEVERABILITYÍ¾ HEADINGS.  If any provision herein is held
                  to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the
      remaining provisions will continue in full force without being
   impaired or invalidated in any way.  The parties agree to replace
              any invalid provision with a valid provision that most
          closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the
    invalid provision.  Headings are for reference purposes only and

                                    scope or extent of such section.
12.3 PUBLICITY.  Prior to the release of any press releases or other
        similar promotional materials related to this Agreement, the
  releasing party shall submit a written request for approval to the
      other party with a copy of the materials to be released, which

Rank 5: 8.2 TERMINATION FOR BREACH.  In addition to other remedies that
may be available to it, by providing written notice, a party
may immediately terminate this Agreement: (a) if the other party
materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure that
breach within sixty (60) days after receiving written
notice of the breach, or (b) as provided in Sections 2.2  [INITIAL INFORMATION TRANSFER MECHANISM DEVELOPMENT],
2.4  [RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS], or 12.4.
","The contract includes a limitation on liability in Section 10, specifying that ""EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF A BREACH OF SECTION 11, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS (HOWEVER ARISING, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT."" This suggests a cap on liability, as it limits the types of damages for which a party may seek recovery.

However, it does not explicitly state a maximum amount for recovery or a time limitation for bringing claims. Section 10âs wording implies that liability is limited for various claims, but clarity on whether there are monetary caps or specific time frames for initiating claims may require legal review for thorough interpretation and implications.

A lawyer should specifically review:

1. Section 10 for any potential implied caps or limits on recoverable amounts.
2. Any additional context within the indemnity provisions (Section 9) that might interact with liability limits.
3. The impact of Section 11, as violations of confidentiality may lead to different liability considerations, which could influence overall liability caps. 

Overall, while there is a limitation on types of damages, further examination for specific caps on monetary recovery and time limitations is advisable.",1

","In the context provided, the relevant section pertaining to ""Exclusivity"" is as follows:

During the term of this Agreement, unless otherwise authorized at the sole discretion of ADAMS GOLF in writing, CONSULTANT shall not:

This section suggests there is a commitment implied by the CONSULTANT not to engage in certain activities that may conflict with the interests of ADAMS GOLF during the term of the Agreement. 

However, the explicit details regarding specific obligations, prohibitions, and potential consequences for violations are crucial. It would be advisable for a lawyer to review this section to understand:

1. Any exclusive dealing commitments that limit the CONSULTANT from working with third parties in terms of endorsements or related services.
2. The extent of the prohibition on licensing, selling, or collaborating with other parties, both during and after the term of the contract.
3. The implications of the clause âunless otherwise authorized at the sole discretion of ADAMS GOLF in writing,â as it raises questions about what constitutes authorization and its enforceability.

A comprehensive review by a lawyer would ensure that all terms related to exclusivity are clearly understood and compliant with applicable laws.",1
