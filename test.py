query = "What is the impact of the federal tax system on small business?"
context = '''The impact of the federal tax system on small business has been a matter of in-
        creasing interest and concern to many persons durinj the last few years. When the
        heavy spending during World War II forced Congress to increase very sharply
        federal taxes on both individual and corporate income, it was confidently expected
        that the high wartime rates would be reduced to more reasonable levels once hostili-
        ties had ended. Unfortunately, these expectations have been realized only to a very
        limited extent.
        Although we were finally able to let the wartime tax on excess profits expire in
        1954, we have not been able to go very far in reducing personal or corporate income
        taxes. In fact, the present fifty-two per cent rate on corporate profits in excess of
        $25,ooo is a good deal higher than the forty per cent rate on ordinary profits that was
        in effect during World War II. Rates on personal income have been reduced slightly
        since the war; but most of the relief which individual taxpayers have received since
        then has taken other forms. Higher exemptions and new deductions and exclusions
        have reduced the percentage of personal income subject to taxation; and the option
        given to married couples to file joint returns so as to enjoy the advantages of "income-
        splitting" gave substantial tax relief to many of these taxpayers. In the field of
        business taxation, relief has taken the form of more liberal depreciation and depletion
        allowances, greater opportunities to give expense treatment to research and develop-
        ment outlays, and longer periods for averaging out profits and losses. Many of the
        changes made in federal business taxation between 1946 and 1954 were helpful to
        small business; but they still left small enterprises, as well as large ones, with tax
        burdens that were enormously greater than those which they had experienced before
        the war.
        While this burden of federal taxation was known to be a repressant to all business,
        its impact was thought to have been especially severe on small businesses, mainly
        because they had little or no access to public markets for capital. Furthermore,
        despite the efforts that had been made to aid small business in the 1954 revenue
        revisions, it was argued that the law still contained provisions which unintentionally
        discriminated against small concerns. Attention was also called to some evidence
        that high federal taxes were discouraging the formation of new small enterprises
        and were impeding the growth of old ones.'''

context2 = '''Risks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing
        Failure to estimate customer demand accurately has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.
        We use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed wafer, component
        and capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are inaccurate, as
        we have experienced in the past, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and
        excess inventory, has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results.
        We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into long-
        term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient
        15
        Table of Contents
        commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These risks may increase as we shorten our
        product development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain
        complexity. Additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are not available
        from third parties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply
        or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended. We have previously experienced and may continue to experience extended lead
        times of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and
        may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scale their capabilities to meet our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity,
        which may require additional deposits. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines.
        Many additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products,
        or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:
        • changes in product development cycles and time to market;
        • competing technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;
        • changes in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand;
        • sudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of global or local health issues;
        • rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
        • the availability of sufficient data center capacity and energy for customers to procure;
        • new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;
        • new or unexpected end-use cases;
        • increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;
        • business decisions made by third parties;
        • the demand for accelerated or AI-related cloud services, including our own software and NVIDIA DGX Cloud services;
        • changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;
        • the demand for our products; or
        • government actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage.
        Demand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024. Entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering customer demand indications across
        several product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply and
        capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. These increased purchase
        volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. We may continue to
        enter into new supplier and capacity arrangements. Our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal
        year 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certain components. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains very
        strong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if
        our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.
        Our customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in the past. Product transitions are
        complex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship
        and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center,
        Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI
        opportunities.  The  increased  frequency  of  these  transitions  may  magnify  the  challenges  associated  with  managing  our  supply  and  demand  due  to  long
        manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of
        prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience
        reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate'''
